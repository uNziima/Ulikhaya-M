# Hi, I'm Ulikhaya Mazibuko 👋

🎯 Aspiring Software Developer | Web Development | Java

I'm a South African software development student deeply passionate about building innovative solutions through code. I'm currently focused on developing my skills in **Java**, while also having experience with **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript** as secondary fundamentals.

🛠️ I'm working on the **first version of a personal project called _We Learn Smart_**, which lays the foundation for something much bigger. This initial version is just the beginning of a broader vision aimed at addressing real-world problems through practical, accessible software, more details to come as the project evolves.

I'm committed to continuously learning, exploring new tools and technologies and growing my capabilities as a developer. Whether it's refining logic, improving UI/UX or deploying better backend solutions, I'm always pushing to understand more.
